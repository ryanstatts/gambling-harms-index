# Gambling Harms Severity Index

The Gambling Harms Severity Index (GHSI) is a validated measurement tool designed to assess the severity of gambling-related harms using Rasch modeling and Item Response Theory.
Key Features

- **Evidence-based** measurement developed through rigorous psychometric testing
- **Standardized** scoring that transforms raw responses into interval-level measurements
- **Benchmarking** to health utility decrements for meaningful interpretation
- **Comparative framework** for evaluation against other harm measures

# For Researchers

The GHSI provides a psychometrically robust tool for measuring gambling harm severity in research contexts.

# For Clinicians

The GHSI offers an objective assessment tool to evaluate gambling-related harm and track changes over time.
