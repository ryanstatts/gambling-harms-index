**The Gambling Harms Scale Initiative ** is a suite of comprehensive, person-centered tools for measuring the full range of gambling harms and recovery. 

**The Gambling Harms Severity Index (GHSI):** Encapsulates all the core components of gambling harm, including financial harms, mental and physical wellbeing harms, and relationship harms.  

**The GHSI for Affected Others (GHSI-AO):** Mirroring the GSHI, the GHSI-AO is an instrument designed to specifically capture the harms experienced by people affected by someone else’s gambling. 




## How is the GHSI different to other measurement tools?

Co-developed with lived-experience input, the GHSI prioritises what matters most, thereby offering a clearer and more accurate picture of harm. This helps ensure more useful information for providers of gambling support services, more robust information for researchers, and a clearer picture for data policymakers. 


-   **Co-designed by those with lived experience, support and treatment backgrounds, and academic expertise.**
-   **It turns personal experiences into meaningful data.** Harms from gambling are transformed into standardised, interval-level scores—allowing for precise tracking of harm severity and change over time.
-   **The GHSI has been designed following the tenants of person-centredness and positive psychology, and avoids the pathologisation of gambling.**
-   **It’s grounded in robust science.** The GHSI has been developed using rigorous psychometric testing to ensure that it measures gambling harms accurately, reliably, and fairly.
-   **Through benchmarking to health utility decrements it links to broader health outcomes.** Providing healthcare professionals and policy makers alike the ability to better understand how harmful gambling may lead to decrements to health and wellbeing.
-   **It enables clear comparisons.** The GHSI provides a framework for comparing gambling harm across populations, over time, and even compare results with other historic tools (such as the PGSI) supporting better evaluation of interventions, services, and policy.


## Gambling Harms Framework

The GHSI scales are underpinned by a *Holistic Framework of Gambling Harms & Recovery*, which was iteratively developed through robust interrogation of academic literature, alongside in-depth qualitative interviews with people who gamble and affected others.
