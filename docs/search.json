      "contents": "\r\nConverter Tool\r\nThe GHSI allows scores to be converted into decrements in health utility and capability on both the SF-6D and the ICECAP-A (which is recommended by NICE when measuring and valuing effects for non-health interventions). This enables health economic benchmarking to be derived from the GSHI.\r\n\r\nA conversion tool will soon be available on this page.\r\n\r\nRasch Details\r\nUnderstanding the Rasch Conversion\r\nWhen you take a gambling assessment like the PGSI, your raw score doesn’t tell the complete story. The converter uses the Rasch measurement model—a sophisticated statistical approach—to transform these raw scores into more meaningful measures.\r\nThink of it like converting temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius. Raw scores are like Fahrenheit: they count items but don’t create equal intervals between points. Rasch measures are like Celsius: they place your score on a standard scale where each step represents an equal amount of change in gambling harm severity. This transformation accounts for the fact that some questions indicate more severe problems than others, and that moving from a score of 20 to 21 might not represent the same increase in severity as moving from 2 to 3.\r\nThe standard error shown with your measure represents the precision of the measurement—smaller errors indicate more confidence in the score. The wider the error bar, the less certain we can be about the exact level of severity. This typically happens at the extreme ends of the scale where fewer people score, giving us less information to make precise estimates.\r\nTechnical Details\r\nThis calculator transforms ordinal raw scores from gambling harm assessment instruments into interval-level measures using Rasch Measurement Theory (RMT). The conversion implements a logit transformation derived from the Rasch model’s probabilistic framework, where the log-odds of a person endorsing an item is a function of that person’s ability (θ) minus the item’s difficulty (δ).Item difficulty represents how hard it is to agree to an item based on one’s underlying trait. Those high in a trait (in this instance gambling-related harm) will be able answer more difficult items in the affirmative, those low in the trait will not.\r\nThe measures are calibrated using a joint maximum likelihood estimation procedure where both person and item parameters are iteratively estimated. The output logits represent the location of each raw score on a latent continuum of gambling harm severity with standardized units. Unlike raw scores, these interval measures maintain equal distances between units across the scale, satisfying the mathematical requirements for parametric statistical analyses.\r\nThe displayed standard errors quantify measurement precision as a function of information at each point along the continuum. In accordance with measurement theory, precision is highest near the center of the distribution where most respondents are measured, and decreases at the extremes. The standard error provides conditional standard deviations of measurement that can be used to construct confidence intervals around individual estimates.\r\nThe severity classifications are empirically derived threshold points on the logit scale that correspond to clinically meaningful distinctions in gambling harm profiles informed by the PGSI. By utilising this interval-level metric rather than raw scores, the calculator enables more accurate assessment of severity, more appropriate measurement of change, and enhanced comparability across different instruments when equated to the same frame of reference.\r\nDecrements to wellbeing are calculated from a propensity weighted model of gambling-related harm (determined by the PGSI) on mental wellbeing (determined by the Warick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "author": [],
      "contents": "\r\nGambling harm isn’t just about losing money. It can affect people’s wellbeing, relationships, and everyday functioning—and these harms are often deeply connected. To truly understand gambling harm, we need to look beyond isolated symptoms and consider how harms build, overlap, and shift over time – including the reduction or recovery from these harms.\r\nThat’s the purpose of the GHSI’s holistic frameworks.\r\nSeeing the full picture of harm - and recovery\r\nAt the heart of the Gambling Harms Scale Initiative is a framework that maps the wide range of ways gambling can impact people. This model was developed from rich, in-depth interviews with people who had lived experience of gambling harm—whether through their own gambling or that of someone close to them. For details of the development process, please see our publications.\r\nThe Framework comes in two parts, the first part represents that interconnected network of harm. But the Framework doesn’t just identify harm, it helps us see how people build resilience and recover from gambling harms - this is encapsulated in our Recovery Framework.\r\nMany people move through cycles of harm, stability, and improvement. The Framework recognises that recovery isn’t always linear, and that progress can look different for different people. By showing how harms are connected, it also shows how positive change in one area—like mental wellbeing or financial stability—can unlock improvements in others.\r\nThe Frameworks at a Glance\r\n\r\nThis visual map of gambling harms is organised into three broad components:\r\nWellbeing Harms — including mental and physical wellbeing impacts such as stress, anxiety, depression, and self-neglect.\r\nResource Harms — such as financial strain, impacts to important activities like work or study, and instances of ethical lapses.\r\nRelationship Harms — including “loss of presence” in family life and relationship tensions, breakdown or disconnection across personal, social, and community relationships.\r\nEach area is interconnected. The diagram shows how harms flow, overlap, and compound.\r\n\r\nFrom Harms to Capital. This change represents the resilience building at the heart of recovery. Recovery is focused on rebuilding from previous experience of harm.\r\nMore than abstinence. Our lived experience and service provider experts helped us steer the Framework towards a more nuanced definition of recovery that works for as many people as possible.\r\nAt the center of the framework is recovery. This represents the personal journey of moving out of harm, including regaining control over gambling and life decisions, developing insight into what led to harm, taking ownership of the steps forward, and making meaningful behaviour change.\r\nWhy this framework matters\r\nIt centres lived experience The model reflects how people actually experience harm and recovery, in their own words.\r\nIt informs better support. From frontline services to national policy, this approach helps professionals recognise and respond to the full impact of gambling — and the pathways out of it.\r\nIt supports meaningful measurement. This framework underpins the Gambling Harms Severity Index, which allows people and services to track harm and recovery over time\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nThe Gambling Harms Severity Index (GHSI) provides a set of innovative, evidence-based tools for measuring gambling-related harm and recovery. These tools go beyond identifying whether someone gambles “too much”—they capture the real impacts that gambling can have on people’s lives, in ways that are meaningful to individuals, practitioners, researchers, and policymakers alike.\r\nWhy we needed a new approach\r\nMost existing measures of gambling – such as the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI) focus on financial loss or behavioural symptoms. But harm isn’t just about money or frequency—it’s about the broader consequences for a person’s health, relationships, and everyday wellbeing. The GHSI tools were created to fill this gap.\r\nHow the tools were developed\r\nFor details of the development process, see our publications. The GHSI measures were developed through a multi-stage process that combined:\r\nLived experience – Our tools were shaped by in-depth interviews and co-production with people affected by gambling (both directly and indirectly) and people delivering services to reduce gambling harms.\r\nRigorous psychometrics – A large-scale national survey was used to refine and test items statistically, ensuring the tools are valid, reliable, and sensitive to change.\r\nIterative design – Items were tested, revised, and scored using modern measurement theory (including Rasch Measurement Theory) to create high-quality, interval-level measures.\r\nWhat the tools measure\r\nThe GHSI tools assess gambling-related harm across three components:\r\nWellbeing – including mental and physical wellbeing\r\nResources – including financial hardship, and work or study disruption\r\nRelationships – including conflict, breakdown, and social isolation\r\nHow the tools are scored\r\nEach harm component is scored on an interval-level scale, allowing meaningful comparisons between people and over time.\r\nThe scoring enables tracking of change, making it suitable for use in both clinical and community settings.\r\nA key advantage of the GHSI is that it allows the calculation of decrements to wellbeing, using standardised utility measures.\r\nThis means that gambling harms can be interpreted with the same approach used in wider public health and economic evaluations.\r\nWhat the tools can be used for\r\nIn support services – To assess clients’ starting points, track recovery, and guide tailored support.\r\nIn research – To provide robust, person-centred data on gambling harms and their impact.\r\nIn policy – To inform public health approaches, economic modelling, and evaluation of interventions or regulatory changes.\r\nIn population surveys – To measure gambling harm and wellbeing impact at a national or regional level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This helps ensure more useful information for providers of gambling support services, more robust information for researchers, and a clearer picture for data policymakers.\r\nCo-designed by those with lived experience, support and treatment backgrounds, and academic expertise.\r\nIt turns personal experiences into meaningful data. Harms from gambling are transformed into standardised, interval-level scores—allowing for precise tracking of harm severity and change over time.\r\nThe GHSI has been designed following the tenants of person-centredness and positive psychology, and avoids the pathologisation of gambling.\r\nIt’s grounded in robust science. The GHSI has been developed using rigorous psychometric testing to ensure that it measures gambling harms accurately, reliably, and fairly.\r\nThrough benchmarking to health utility decrements it links to broader health outcomes. Providing healthcare professionals and policy makers alike the ability to better understand how harmful gambling may lead to decrements to health and wellbeing.\r\nIt enables clear comparisons. The GHSI provides a framework for comparing gambling harm across populations, over time, and even compare results with other historic tools (such as the PGSI) supporting better evaluation of interventions, services, and policy.\r\nGambling Harms Framework\r\nThe GHSI scales are underpinned by a Holistic Framework of Gambling Harms & Recovery, which was iteratively developed through robust interrogation of academic literature, alongside in-depth qualitative interviews with people who gamble and affected others.

(2025).\r\nPsyArXiv. https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/yudq6_v1\r\nThis study developed a holistic, empirically grounded framework of gambling-related harm and recovery tailored to the Great Britain context. Through a Rapid Evidence Assessment and 40 qualitative interviews with people experiencing gambling harms and affected others, the framework encompasses three broad components of harm: resources, wellbeing, and relationships. It explicitly acknowledges stigma as a gambling harm and conceptualises recovery as a multidimensional process involving financial stability, identity repair, and social connection, underpinned by support networks alongside control, insight, behaviour change, and ownership. The framework advances gambling harms research by integrating lived experience, acknowledging affected others, and embedding recovery as a central component.\r\nDevelopment and Validation of the Gambling Harms Severity Index (GHSI-10) and the GHSI for Affected Others (GHSI-AO-10): Measurement Instruments for People Experiencing Gambling Related Harms and Affected Others.\r\nClose, J., Statton, R., Collard, S., Wheaton, J., Davies, S., Martin, I., Pinto, C., Conway, M., Walsh, C., & Browne, M. (2025).\r\nPsyArXiv. https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/w8fb6_v1\r\nThis study reports the development and validation of the GHSI-10 and GHSI-AO-10, co-designed instruments for measuring gambling-related harms among people who gamble and affected others. Using a multi-phase, mixed-methods approach grounded in a holistic framework of gambling harm and recovery, items were co-produced with individuals with lived experience, affected others, practitioners, and academic experts. Psychometric validation conducted with over 3,000 participants in the UK demonstrated strong reliability, convergent validity with existing measures, and good fit using both classical test theory and Rasch measurement approaches. The instruments use non-stigmatising, person-centred language designed to reduce denial and social desirability biases, with a focus on harms that are dynamic and responsive to recovery pathways.\r\nAcademic Research\r\nRecent citations here\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
