      "contents": "\r\nGambling harm isn’t just about losing money. It can affect people’s health, relationships, and everyday functioning—and these harms are often deeply connected. To truly understand gambling harm, we need to look beyond isolated symptoms and consider how harms build, overlap, and shift over time – including the reduction or recovery from these harms.\r\nThat’s the purpose of the GHSI’s holistic framework.\r\nSeeing the full picture of harm - and recovery\r\nAt the heart of the Gambling Harms Scale Initiative is a framework that maps the wide range of ways gambling can impact people. This model was developed from rich, in-depth interviews with people who had lived experience of gambling harm—whether through their own gambling or that of someone close to them.\r\nThe framework doesn’t just identify harm—it helps us see how people recover.\r\nMany people move through cycles of harm, stability, and improvement. The framework recognises that recovery isn’t always linear, and that progress can look different for different people. By showing how harms are connected, it also shows how positive change in one area—like mental health or financial stability—can unlock improvements in others.\r\nThe Framework at a Glance\r\n\r\nThis visual map of gambling harms is organised into three broad domains:\r\nHealth Harms — including mental and physical health impacts such as stress, anxiety, depression, and self-neglect.\r\nResource harms — such as financial strain, lost opportunities in work or study, or involvement with debt or crime.\r\nRelationship harms — including “loss of presence” in family life and relationship tensions, breakdown or disconnection across personal, social, and community relationships.\r\nAt the center of the framework is recovery. This represents the personal journey of moving out of harm, including regaining control over gambling and life decisions, developing insight into what led to harm, taking ownership of the steps forward, and making meaningful behaviour change.\r\nEach area is interconnected. The diagram shows how harms flow, overlap, and compound.\r\nWhy this framework matters\r\nIt centres lived experience The model reflects how people actually experience harm and recovery, in their own words.\r\nIt informs better support. From frontline services to national policy, this approach helps professionals recognise and respond to the full impact of gambling — and the pathways out of it.\r\nIt supports meaningful measurement. This framework underpins the Gambling Harms Scale (GHS), which allows people and services to track harm and recovery over time\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nThe Gambling Harms Scale Initiative (GHSI) provides a set of innovative, evidence-based tools for measuring gambling-related harm and recovery. These tools go beyond identifying whether someone gambles “too much”—they capture the real impacts that gambling can have on people’s lives, in ways that are meaningful to individuals, practitioners, researchers, and policymakers alike.\r\nWhy we needed a new approach\r\nMost existing measures of gambling – such as the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI) focus on financial loss or behavioural symptoms. But harm isn’t just about money or frequency—it’s about the broader consequences for a person’s health, relationships, and everyday wellbeing. The GHSI tools were created to fill this gap.\r\nHow the tools were developed\r\nThe GHSI measures were developed through a multi-stage process that combined:\r\nLived experience – Our tools were shaped by in-depth interviews and co-production with people affected by gambling (both directly and indirectly) and people delivering services to reduce gambling harms.\r\nRigorous psychometrics – A large-scale national survey was used to refine and test items statistically, ensuring the tools are valid, reliable, and sensitive to change.\r\nIterative design – Items were tested, revised, and scored using modern measurement theory (including Rasch Measurement Theory) to create high-quality, interval-level measures.\r\nWhat the tools measure\r\nThe GHSI tools assess gambling-related harm across three domains:\r\nHealth – including mental and physical wellbeing\r\nResources – including financial hardship, work or study disruption, and legal consequences\r\nRelationships – including conflict, breakdown, and social isolation\r\nAt the heart of the measure is recovery, which captures progress through four core areas: control, insight, ownership, and behaviour change.\r\nHow the tools are scored\r\nEach harm domain is scored on an interval-level scale, allowing meaningful comparisons between people and over time.\r\nScores are calibrated to reflect both the severity and personal significance of the harm experienced.\r\nThe scoring enables tracking of change, making it suitable for use in both clinical and community settings.\r\nA key advantage of the GHSI is that it allows the calculation of decrements to wellbeing, using standardised utility measures.\r\nThis means that gambling harms can be interpreted with the same approach used in wider public health and economic evaluations.\r\nCompatibility with other tools\r\nTo support continuity in the field:\r\nGHSI score cam be inter-converted with the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI), making it possible to compare data or transition smoothly from older tools.\r\nThis enables services and researchers to bridge between traditional “risk” assessments and more holistic harm-based approaches.\r\nWhat the tools can be used for\r\nIn support services – To assess clients’ starting points, track recovery, and guide tailored support.\r\nIn research – To provide robust, person-centred data on gambling harms and their impact.\r\nIn policy – To inform public health approaches, economic modelling, and evaluation of interventions or regulatory changes.\r\nIn population surveys – To measure gambling harm and wellbeing impact at a national or regional level.\r\nPutting people at the centre\r\nUnlike many existing measures, the GHSI tools were designed not just for analysis—but for use with real people. The language is clear, the questions are meaningful, and the scoring reflects what people themselves say matters most.\r\nWhether you’re a frontline worker, academic, commissioner or advocate, these tools offer a more human, accurate and actionable way to understand and respond to gambling harm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nThe Gambling Harms Scale Initiative (GHSI) is a major UK-based research programme that’s transforming how we understand and respond to gambling-related harm. Working directly with people affected by gambling, we have developed the first comprehensive, person-centered tool for measuring the full range of gambling harms—not just financial loss, but also impacts on health, relationships, work, and wellbeing.\r\nBy capturing these experiences in people’s own words and prioritising what matters most to them, the GHSI offers a clearer, fairer, and more accurate picture of harm. This helps ensure more useful information for providers of gambling support services, more robust information for researchers, and a clearer picture for data policymakers.\r\nHow is the GHSI different to other measurement tools, such as the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI)?\r\nIt turns personal experiences into meaningful data. Harms from gambling are transformed into standardised, interval-level scores—allowing for precise tracking of harm severity and change over time.\r\nIt’s grounded in robust science. The GHSI has been developed using rigorous psychometric testing to ensure that it measures gambling harms accurately, reliably, and fairly.\r\nIt links to broader health outcomes. By benchmarking GHSI scores against established health utility scales, the results can be interpreted in meaningful, real-world terms—helping decision-makers understand the true impact of gambling harm on people’s lives.\r\nIt enables clear comparisons. The GHSI provides a framework for comparing gambling harm across populations, over time, and even compare results with other historic tools such as the PGSI—supporting better evaluation of interventions, services, and policy.\r\nGambling Harms Framework\r\nThe Gambling Harms Framework\r\nGambling Harms Severity Index\r\nThe Gambling Harms Severity Index (GHSI) is a suite of measurement tools designed to assess the severity of gambling-related harms using Rasch modeling and Item Response Theory. Different, validated, version of the tool exist for both those directly affected and affected others. The GHSI has been designed following the tenants of person-centredness and positive psychology, and avoids the pathologisation of gambling.\r\nGHSI has been mapped to legacy measures of gambling-related harm that you might already be familiar with. This offers you the opportunity to compare against measures taken before the introduction of GHSI as well as research/guidance that refers to other measures of gambling-related harm.\r\nGHSI is also mapped to health-utility. Giving healthcare professionals and researchers alike the ability to better understand how harmful gambling may lead to decrements to health and wellbeing.\r\nKey Features\r\nEvidence-based measurement developed through rigorous psychometric testing\r\nCo-designed by those with lived experience, support and treatment backgrounds, and academic expertise\r\nStandardized scoring that transforms raw responses into interval-level measurements\r\nBenchmarking to health utility decrements for meaningful interpretation\r\nComparative framework for evaluation against other harm measures\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
