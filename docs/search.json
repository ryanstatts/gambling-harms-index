While many tools focus on problem gambling behaviors, the GHSI specifically measures the severity of experienced harms.\r\nMethodology\r\nThe GHSI was developed using:\r\nQualitative research with gambling harm experts and those with lived experience\r\nItem Response Theory to validate the measurement structure\r\nRasch analysis to create an interval scale of harm severity\r\nHealth utility mapping to benchmark severity against standardized health decrements\r\nTechnical Details\r\nThe GHSI employs a [technical details about your Rasch model]. This approach allows for:\r\nItem invariance across different populations\r\nConversion of ordinal responses to interval measurements\r\nRobust comparison between individuals and groups\r\nResearch Team\r\nDr. James Close - The University of Plymouth\r\nDr. Ryan Statton - The University of Plymouth\r\nContact\r\nFor research collaborations or technical questions about the GHSI, please contact [your email].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
