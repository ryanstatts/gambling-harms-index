## Overview

The Gambling Harms Scale Initiative is a major UK-based research programme transforming how we understand and respond to gambling-related harm. Working directly with people affected by gambling, we have developed a suite of comprehensive, person-centered tools for measuring the full range of gambling harms and recovery.

## Measurement Tools

### Three Main Instruments:

1. **The Gambling Harms Severity Index (GHSI)**: Encapsulates all the core domains of gambling harm, including financial harms, mental and physical health harms, and relationship harms.

2. **The GHSI for Affected Others (GHSI-AO)**: Mirroring the GHSI, this instrument is designed to specifically capture the harms experienced by people affected by someone else's gambling.

3. **The Gambling Harms Recovery Index (GHRI)**: A tool for measuring the recovery of harms from gambling. Having a more holistic perspective than simply measuring abstinence, the GHRI encapsulates aspects such as personal insight and behaviour change.

## Theoretical Foundation

The GHSI scales are underpinned by a **Holistic Framework of Gambling Harms & Recovery**, which was iteratively developed through robust interrogation of academic literature, alongside in-depth qualitative interviews with people who gamble and affected others.

Several papers are currently in preparation:
- Framework development paper
- Validation study
- Health utility analysis

*By capturing gambling harm experiences in people's own words and prioritising what matters most to them, the GHSI tools offer a clearer, fairer, and more accurate picture of harm.*
